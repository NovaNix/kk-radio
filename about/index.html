                    <p>
                        When I started playing Animal Crossing one my favorite features was the radio that played random K.K. slider
                        songs. I also heavily enjoyed collecting as many K.K. songs as I could. For a while I had the desire to recreate the in-game radios in real life. <br> <br>
                    
                        With this idea in mind, when I started learning web development I thought it would be a fun test project.

                    <summary>Where did you get the assets from?</summary>
                    <p>
                        All of the data used in the projet is scraped from Nookipedia. <br>
                        All of the images, audio, etc are all owned by Nintendo. <br> <br>

                        The project does not actually store any of these assets server side, theyre all linked back to the locations stored on Nookipedia's servers.
                    </p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Why didn't you use the Nookipedia API to get the assets?</summary>
                    <p>
                        The Nookipedia API lacks access to the music used in the game, so web-scraping was necessary.
                        Additionally their api is better suited for server side applications, which this is not. <br> <br>
        
                        I could maybe go through their media api thing but they've stated that the music layout is inconsistant and
                        will likely break in the future, so I decided to go the easy route and just scrape the information. <br> <br>
        
                        If someone from Nookipedia finds this project and knows a better solution, I'll gladly use it.
