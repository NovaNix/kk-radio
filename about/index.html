                <summary>Why did you make this website?</summary>
                When I started playing Animal Crossing one my favorite features was the radio that played random K.K. slider songs. 
                I also heavily enjoyed collecting as many K.K. songs as I could. For a while I had the desire to recreate the in-game radios in real life
                With this idea in mind, when I started learning web development I thought it would be a fun test project.

                <summary>Where did you get the assets from?</summary>
                All of the data used in the projet is scraped from Nookipedia. All of the images, audio, etc are all owned by Nintendo.
                The project does not actually store any of these assets server side, theyre all linked back to the locations stored on Nookipedia's servers.
            </details>

                <summary>Why didn't you use the Nookipedia API to get the assets?</summary>
                The Nookipedia API lacks access to the music used in the game, so web-scraping was necessary. 
                Additionally their api is better suited for server side applications, which this is not. 
                
                I could maybe go through their media api thing but they've stated that the music layout is inconsistant and will likely break in the future, so I decided to go the easy route and just scrape the information.

                If someone from Nookipedia finds this project and knows a better solution, I'll gladly use it.
